# IdentityVerification Smart Contract

## Vision

The **IdentityVerification** smart contract aims to provide a decentralized and transparent mechanism for verifying user identities on-chain. It allows a trusted entity (verifier) to verify a user, enabling trust in blockchain-based applications that require identity validation.

## Features

- **Verify User**:
  - A verifier can verify a user's identity and record it on-chain.
- **Check Verification**:
  - Users or applications can check if a user has been verified and by whom.

## Future Scope

1. **Multi-Level Verification**:

   - Enable multiple verifiers for additional layers of identity verification.

2. **Revocation**:

   - Add functionality to revoke verification if the user's status changes.

3. **Reputation System**:
   - Integrate a reputation system based on the user's verification history.

The **IdentityVerification** contract provides a decentralized solution to enhance trust in blockchain interactions by enabling reliable identity verification.
